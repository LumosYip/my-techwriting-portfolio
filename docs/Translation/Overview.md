# CAT Overview

Computer-Aided Translation (CAT) refers to a set of tools and technologies designed to support human translators and improve translation quality, efficiency, and consistency.  
CAT tools do **not** replace translators—instead, they provide a structured environment for managing terminology, leveraging past translations, and streamlining workflows.

## Why CAT Tools Matter

CAT tools are widely used in software localization, technical documentation, and large-scale multilingual projects because they help:

- **Increase productivity**  
  Reuse existing translations through Translation Memory (TM).

- **Ensure consistency**  
  Maintain consistent terminology with integrated Glossary/Termbases.

- **Reduce costs**  
  Match rates make repetitive content cheaper to manage.

- **Improve accuracy**  
  Built-in QA checks detect formatting, terminology, and tag issues.

- **Enable collaboration**  
  Cloud-based CAT tools allow multiple translators and reviewers to work simultaneously.

## Key Components of CAT Tools

### 1. Translation Memory (TM)

A database storing previously translated sentence pairs (source & target).  

When similar sentences appear in new documents, the CAT tool suggests matches to speed up translation.

### 2. Terminology / Glossary

A collection of approved terms and their translations.  

Glossaries help maintain consistency, especially in UI strings, product names, or technical terms.

### 3. Editor Interface

A structured segment-by-segment translation environment that supports:

- Real-time TM suggestions  
- Glossary highlights  
- Tags and placeholders  
- Auto-propagation of repeated segments  

### 4. Machine Translation (Optional)

Some CAT tools integrate MT engines (e.g., Google, DeepL) to provide draft suggestions.

### 5. QA & Validation

Automated checks include:

- Missing numbers, tags, or punctuation  
- Inconsistent terminology  
- Formatting mismatch  

### 6. Project & File Management

CAT tools support various file formats:
- `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`
- `.xml`, `.html`
- `.json`, `.yaml`
- Software localization formats such as `.po`, `.strings`, `.resx`

## Typical CAT Workflow

1. **Prepare files**  
2. **Create project & set languages**  
3. **Load TM & Glossary**  
4. **Translate segment by segment**  
5. **Run QA checks**  
6. **Review & finalize**  
7. **Export translated files**  
8. **Update TM for future reuse**

## When to Use CAT Tools

CAT tools are ideal for:
- Large or repetitive content  
- Software UI strings  
- User guides and manuals  
- Release notes  
- Multilingual websites  
- Continuous localization workflows

## Summary

CAT tools enhance translation quality and efficiency without replacing human translators.  

They streamline workflows, enforce consistency, and support scalable localization processes—making them essential in modern translation and documentation environments.
