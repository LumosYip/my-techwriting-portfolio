# Hi, I'm Lumos — Technical Writer / Documentation Engineer

## Why This Repository Exists

This repo is basically my little corner for organizing notes, trying out different documentation styles, and building a personal documentation website with MkDocs.

I’ve been exploring technical writing, translation workflows, and a bit of forensics-related documentation, so I wanted a place to structure everything, and GitHub Pages happens to be a perfect fit.
